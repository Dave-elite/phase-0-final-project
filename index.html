               <p>
                Cupping is a sensory evaluation method used to assess the quality and characteristics of coffee. 
                <br>In this process, freshly brewed coffee samples are systematically evaluated for aroma, 
                <br>flavor, acidity, body, and aftertaste. It involves slurping the coffee to aerate it across
                <br> the palate, allowing for a thorough assessment of its sensory attributes. Cupping sessions
                <br> are crucial for coffee professionals to determine coffee quality, consistency, and potential
                <br> defects, thus informing decisions in sourcing, blending, and roasting.</p>
